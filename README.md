- 👋 Hello to anyone who finds this page, my name is Cassandra Alvarado :)
- 🌱 I’m a Master's Student currently studying Epidemiology and learning R, SQL, and Python! I'm new to the field of coding and data but I'm exciting to learn as much as I can
- 💞️ My distant goal is to become involved with Artificial Intelligence in the field of Healthcare and continue the push for women and minorties to be taken into account early on in projects, as opposed to being an after thought.  
- 📫 If you have any advice, ideas, or know of any opportunities feel free to email me :)
